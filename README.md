# Boogaloo
dumb lil shell scripts

combineFolders - Combine folders to create 1 master folder with all the contents in alphabetical order.
copyConfigFiles - Backup all current .config files into 1 coherent location, allowing for easy Github backup (with some other settings to change)
desktopNotifs - Folder with failed (for now) Dunst notifications
neofetchRandom - possibly the most random of the group, but will randomly pick a neofetch config whenever "neofetch" is run in the terminal
